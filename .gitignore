# Have editor/IDE/OS specific files you need to ignore? Consider using a global gitignore:
#
# * Create a file at ~/.gitignore
# * Include files you want ignored
# * Run: git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
#
# After doing this, these files will be ignored in all your git projects,
# saving you from having to 'pollute' every project you touch with them
#
# Not sure what to needs to be ignored for particular editors/OSes? Here's some ideas to get you started. (Remember, remove the leading # of the line)
#
# For MacOS:
#
#.DS_Store

# For TextMate
#*.tmproj
#tmtags

# For emacs:
#*~
#\#*
#.\#*

# For vim:
#*.swp

# For redcar:
#.redcar

# For rubinius:
#*.rbc
# Created by http://www.gitignore.io

### Ruby ###
*.gem
*.rbc
/.config
/coverage/
/InstalledFiles
/pkg/
/spec/reports/
/test/tmp/
/test/version_tmp/
/tmp/

## Specific to RubyMotion:
.dat*
.repl_history
build/

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

## Environment normalisation:
/.bundle/
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
